# Data-Structure-ADT-Bag-

In this project, we will implement a class called "bag" to further understand data structure in C++.
For this implementation, we will keep it simple and use vector for data storage, and 
the goal for this is to understand the following:  
[] Basic functions and methods
[] Basis of class including constructors and destructor
[] Base classes and derived classes
[] Templates
